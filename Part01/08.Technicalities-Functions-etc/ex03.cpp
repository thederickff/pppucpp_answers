/*
  Create a vector of Fibonacci numbers and print them using the function from
  exercise 2. To create the vector, write a function, fibonacci(x, y, v, n),
  where integers x and y are ints, v is an empty vector<int>, and n is the
  number of elements to put into v; v[0] will be x and v[1] will be y. A
  Fibonacci number is one that is part of a sequence where each element is the
  sum of the two previous ones. For example, starting with 1 and 2, we get 1, 2,
  3, 5, 8, 13, 21,.... Your fibonacci() function should make such a sequence
  starting with its x and y arguments.
