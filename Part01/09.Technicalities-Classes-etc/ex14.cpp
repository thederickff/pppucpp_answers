/*
  Design and implement a Money class for calculations involving dollars and
  centsw here arithmetic has to be accurate to the last cent using the 4/5
  rounding rule (.5 of a cent rounds up; anything less than .5 rounds down).
  Represent a monetary amount as a number of cents in a long int, but input
  and output as dollars and cents, e.g., $123.45. Do not worry about amounts
  that don't fit into a long int.
