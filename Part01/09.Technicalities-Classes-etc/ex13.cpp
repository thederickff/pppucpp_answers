/*
  Design and implement a rational number class, Rational. A rational number has
  two parts: a numerator and a denominator, for example, 5/6 (five-sixths, also
  known as approximately .83333). Look up the definition if you need to. Provide
  assignment, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equality
  operators. Also, provide a conversion to double. Why would people want to use
  a Rational class?
